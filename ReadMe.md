# Environments  
This repo contains some environment files to create conda environments for different applications software. 

* `environment_gempy_windows`: environment to run gempy on windows 
* `environment_gempy_linux`: environment to run gempy on linux. Differs from the windows version, as e.g. `m2w64-toolchain` isn't needed on linux  
* `environment_gemgis`: environment to run environment_gemgis  
* `environment_gempy_gemgis`: environment to run both, gempy and gemgis (on linux). Useful, as gemgis heavily relies on gempy  
* `environment_gempy_gemgis_windows`: same as above, only added libraries needed for running gempy on windows without problems  
* `environment_mlearn`: basic machine learning environment  
* `environment_datasci`: basic data science environment
